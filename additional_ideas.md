** Flight Creation **
 - Have user enter just the airline/flight number initially
  -> Scrape internet using this info and populate all of the departure/arrival information using this info.
  -> If scrape does not find the required info, ask user if they have the correct airline/flight number. If they do and it's still not functioning properly, give the option to manually enter the required information.
